## Introduction

FUMS v2 is a distributed news management system designed for universities and educational institutions.  

The system includes **four independent components**:  



- **Core API** ‚Äì manages accounts, news articles, categories, and tags.  

- **Analytics API** ‚Äì dashboard, statistics, related article recommendations, Excel export.  

- **AI API** ‚Äì automatically suggests tags based on article content.  

- **Frontend (MVC / Razor Pages)** ‚Äì user interface, CRUD operations, dashboard, offline mode.  



The system demonstrates distributed architecture, HttpClient communication, JWT authentication, background processing, caching, AI-based tag suggestions, and interactive dashboards with Chart.js.

## Objectives / Key Features



- Built with **.NET 8**, **EF Core**, **ASP.NET Core Web API**, **Razor Pages / MVC**  

- Distributed system design with four projects: Core API, Analytics API, AI API, and Frontend  

- **HttpClientFactory** & **DelegatingHandler** for API communication  

- **Background Worker (HostedService)** to refresh cached data periodically  

- AI-powered tag suggestions with learning cache  

- **JWT + Refresh Token** to automatically renew access tokens  

- **Audit Logging** for all CRUD actions: User, Action, Entity, Before/After JSON  

- **SignalR Notification** system for new article alerts  

- **Excel Export** from the dashboard  

- Responsive UI, Bootstrap Modals, Chart.js dashboards, Offline Mode

## Project Components



### Core API

- CRUD operations for **Account, Category, Tag, NewsArticle** (EF Core)  

- JWT Authentication + Refresh Token (`/api/auth/refresh`)  

- Image upload with file type and size validation  

- Audit logging for all user actions  

- Business rules: prevent deletion of related records  

- Standardized JSON responses and HTTP status codes  



### Analytics API

- `/api/analytics/dashboard` ‚Äì total articles by category and status  

- `/api/analytics/trending` ‚Äì trending articles  

- `/api/recommend/{id}` ‚Äì related article recommendations  

- Advanced filtering: date, category, author  

- Excel export: `/api/analytics/export`  



### AI API

- `/api/ai/suggest-tags` ‚Äì suggest tags from article content  

- Accepts JSON: `{ "content": "..." }`  

- Can connect to OpenAI or simulate keyword extraction  

- Maintains learning cache for frequently selected tags  



### Frontend (MVC / Razor Pages)

- Communicates with APIs **only via HttpClient**, no direct DB access  

- Multiple HttpClient instances for Core, Analytics, and AI APIs  

- **Polly Retry Policy** and error alerts for API failures  

- Background Worker refreshes cache every 6 hours  

- Dashboard with Chart.js, CRUD via Bootstrap Modals  

- **Offline Mode**: reads cached JSON, disables CRUD when API is down  

- SignalR Notifications for live updates
